Determine whether there are pneumonia-related abnormalities such as focal opacity, consolidation, or interstitial infiltrates.

The image may contain imaging artefacts or noise (e.g., motion blur, streaks, blocking, or random speckle).
Artefacts are not disease. Base your decision only on the true anatomy and pathology.

The image may contain imaging artefacts or noise (e.g., motion blur, streaks, blocking, or random speckle).
Artefacts are not disease. Base your decision only on the true anatomy and pathology.

Question: Does this image show normal anatomy or signs of disease?
