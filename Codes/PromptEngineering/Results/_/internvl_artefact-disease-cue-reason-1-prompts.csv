This is a brain MRI scan.
First, evaluate overall image quality and imaging artefacts.
Describe whether you see motion blur, streaks, blocking, random speckle, or other artefacts, and whether they limit diagnostic confidence.

Then, focus on brain tissue structure, symmetry, and signal characteristics.
Determine whether there are true abnormalities such as tumors, edema, mass effect, or focal signal changes.

This is a brain MRI scan.
First, evaluate overall image quality and imaging artefacts.
Describe whether you see motion blur, streaks, blocking, random speckle, or other artefacts, and whether they limit diagnostic confidence.

Then, focus on brain tissue structure, symmetry, and signal characteristics.
Determine whether there are true abnormalities such as tumors, edema, mass effect, or focal signal changes.

Question: Considering both image quality and true anatomical findings, is this image normal, diseased, or too distorted for reliable diagnosis?

This is a retinal OCT scan.
First, evaluate overall image quality and imaging artefacts.
Describe whether you see motion blur, streaks, blocking, random speckle, shadowing, or cropping, and whether they limit diagnostic confidence.

Then, focus on retinal layer integrity and the foveal contour.
Determine whether there are pathological features such as drusen-like elevations, intraretinal or subretinal fluid, or abnormal layer thickening or disruption.

Question: Considering both image quality and true anatomical findings, is this image normal, diseased, or too distorted for reliable diagnosis?

First, evaluate overall image quality and imaging artefacts.
Describe whether you see motion blur, streaks, blocking, random speckle, shadowing, or cropping, and whether they limit diagnostic confidence.

Then, focus on retinal layer integrity and the foveal contour.
Determine whether there are pathological features such as drusen-like elevations, intraretinal or subretinal fluid, or abnormal layer thickening or disruption.

Output exactly one JSON object with TWO keys: ""label"" and ""reason"".
The value of ""label"" MUST be one of: ""normal"", ""disease"", or ""distorted"".
First, evaluate image quality and artefacts before deciding the label.
Use ""distorted"" ONLY if artefacts make diagnosis unreliable.
If label is ""distorted"", the reason MUST briefly state which artefacts or quality issues prevent reliable diagnosis.
Keep the reason strictly under 20 words.

This is a chest X-ray image.
First, evaluate overall image quality and imaging artefacts.
Describe whether you see motion blur, grid lines, external objects, under- or over-exposure, or other artefacts, and whether they limit confidence.

Then, focus on the lung fields, heart borders, and costophrenic angles.
Determine whether there are pneumonia-related abnormalities such as focal opacity, consolidation, or interstitial infiltrates.

Question: Considering both image quality and true anatomical findings, is this image normal, diseased, or too distorted for reliable diagnosis?
