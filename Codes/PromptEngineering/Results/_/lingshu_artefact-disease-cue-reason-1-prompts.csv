First, evaluate overall image quality and imaging artefacts.
Describe whether you see motion blur, grid lines, external objects, under- or over-exposure, or other artefacts, and whether they limit confidence.

Then, focus on the lung fields, heart borders, and costophrenic angles.
Determine whether there are pneumonia-related abnormalities such as focal opacity, consolidation, or interstitial infiltrates.

Question: Considering both image quality and true anatomical findings, is this image normal, diseased, or too distorted for reliable diagnosis?
